* Introduction
** My editor journey
*** long time vim users
*** tried and failed with emacs several times
*** found spacemacs and fell in love with emacs combined with modal editing
** Spacemacs
- http://spacemacs.org
- https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
* Survey
** which editors do people use?
*** vim
*** emacs
*** atom
*** sublime
*** an IDE
*** other?

** who configures their editor with scripts?
*** plugins?
*** vimscript?
*** javascript/pytho?
* Lets talk about vim
** Pros
*** very lightweight and portable
*** fast to start up
*** available on virtually any linux machine you'll log into
*** fast modal editing?
** Cons
*** extending is not easy
*** integration with a shell is limited
* Emacs
** Pros
*** extremely extendable
*** fairly universally available
*** Easy to configure!
*** elisp
*** "Emacs is my OS"...
** Cons
*** Difficult to configure
*** elisp
*** Slower to startup, especially with plugins
*** Heavier (but not as bad you might think)
*** Not as universally available as vim
*** non-modal key bindings?
*** multi-key bindings
* Evil mode
** almost complete vim emulation
** some minor differences:
** doesn't handle movement in extremely large files (several GB) files well
** can even handle ex commands
** doesn't understand .vim configuration
** emacs macros are sometimes a better bet
* Concepts and gotchas
** major and minor modes
** frames, windows and buffers
** packages
** elisp
** States (normal, insert, visual, emacs etc)
** Working directory
** Ctrl-g (not ctrl-c)
* Spacemacs features
** Mnemonic
** Discoverable
** Consistent
** "Crowd-Configured".
* Mnemonic & Discoverable
** which key Mnemonic grouping in normal mode
** major mode bindings (, and SPC-m)
** Helm M-x (SPC-SPC)
** help-describe (SPC-h-d) keybinding group (key, function, variable)
** major mode bindings (SPC-?)
* Consistent
** Different modes (generally) have fairly consistent and expected behaviour for a vim users
** Evil mode works globally, through "auto-evilification"
** a set of keys work as per vim in an evilified state (e.g. dired)
****  keys /, :, h, j, k, l, n, N, v, V, gg, G, C-f, C-b, C-d, C-e, C-u, C-y and C-z 
** Some plugins are less well developed, but it's constantly improving
* Crowd-Configured
** spacemacs implements a layer configuration system
** default layers are available on the github repo (and SPC-h-l)
* Some comment
** emacsclient
** easily switch between Emacs and Vim mode with Ctrl-z
** Spacemacs auto-downloads packages, not as simple to set up without an internet connection
** If using a http proxy for internet, use the http_proxy environment variable
** Command line also works well (as long as you export the appropriate TERM variable)
* Issues
** very slow to startup (can use emacsclient)
** Windows shell is limited
*** use eshell (if you want to learn something new)
*** use cygwin
*** use the linux subsystem and X11 (or terminal)
* Helm
** Makes any list filterable list
*** SPC-/ (smart search)
*** SPC-b-b (helm-mini)
*** SPC-f-r (helm-recentf)
*** SPC-SPC (M-x)
*** SPC-s-s (helm-swoop)
*** SPC-f-f (helm-find-files)
*** SPC-p-r (helm-projectile-recentf)
*** Etc...!
* Projectile
** Looks for a VCS folder or a .projectile file - and treats it as a project
** Found under SPC-p
** Namespacing for searches, file lookups from any directory
* Org mode
** easy editing for structured data
*** cycle all levels (shift-TAB)
*** cycle children (ctrl-TAB)
*** to rearrange (Alt- Arrow)
*** new entry (Ctrl-Enter)
** Literate programming
** Agenda and todo management
* Other stuff
** Magit: an incredible porcelain for git ( SPC-g-s)
** Tramp: visit any directory anywhere ( [protocol]:[hostname]:/path/to/file )
** Ediff: the answer to vimdiff
** Terminal: run a terminal emulator inside emacs
*** ansi-term (terminal "without" emacs)
*** shell (dumb terminal with emacs)
*** eshell
* Thanks for listening
** Questions?
